This is my first check-in so it will include a bit more than just this week :ok:

## Work

As of November 10 2025, after 14 years as an employee and 7 years as a independent contractor; I decided to take a break from client work to pursue my own projects full time.

## Project

For the past two and a half, maybe three months I have been working on a game runtime (and niche engine) on the side, using a bunch of Linebender technologies with the ambition of powering my commercial games.

I did previously use Bevy for about one and a half year, but it really messed me and the game project up. Tons of mental overhead due to the indeterminstic nature of it and it's many architectural choices. To be fair I learned A LOT from that experience and it got me to research more about game engines and game runtimes in general.

## Linebender

These first few weeks I have mostly focused on rendering lottie files with Velato; Which has led me to work on a few features and bug fixes in the Velato codebase.

Prior to the work the Noto Unicorn had some issues

But now it's looking better

## Experimentation with Linebender APIs

I also had some fun creating some tilting, glitch and foil animation using only Vello, Kurbo and Peniko APIs without perspective projection.

Exaggerated skew

I am wondering about Kurbo's fit method/function for perspective projections of bezier paths, whether or not they would allow for a better version of the tilting effect. I might investigate that in the future when I have more understanding of Kurbo's internals.

## Learning

Otherwise I am trying to get a better understanding of Vello and Vello Hybrid, eventually the ambition (, as of rigth now,) is to contribute there as well; But I have a big knowledge gap to fill first.

I have been spending many hours on learning Affine transformations, computer vision, linear algebra and matrix math in general.

And also trying to dedicate at least one hour a day to get better at vector art and motion graphics.
