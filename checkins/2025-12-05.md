This week, apart from being a pretty normal and productive week, I read a lot of vello code to figure out how I can contribute more, mostly vello classic and later more focus on sparse strips due to running into conflation artifacts (?) in vello classic.

I started porting my game project to use vello_hybrid instead of vello classic to "rip off the bandaid" so to speak.

As a result of the rewrite I ran into the "gradient within clip layer" bug [issue#1278](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/1278) and opened a PR to fix it [vello#1313](https://github.com/linebender/vello/pull/1313); I spent a bit too much time on it to be honest, but I learned a lot about the vello_hybrid codebase in the process.

This also resulted in me looking into `vello_sparse_tests` a bit more and get that up and running with git lfs and what not.

Otherwise I reviewed a bunch of bevy_vello PRs.

Today was mostly going through my backlog and TODOs and break them apart into smaller tasks more for next week.

I hope to show off or publish some prototypes and isolated game play demos on itch right after new years, depends on how well hybrid runs on wasm though, I have not tried it at all :pray:
